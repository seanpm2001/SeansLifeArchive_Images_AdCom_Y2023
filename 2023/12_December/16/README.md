I made a successful effort to return to this game this week, not playing for a few months. In my session today, I ranked up to rank 69, and made slight progress in the new rank, only completing 1 quest. I did 0 card upgrades this week. I decided not to play the event this week. I eventually wrapped up and quit. I completely forgot to open the free capsules today. On a side note, my Internet was going very slowly tonight (Spectrum claims 99.9% reliability, but they have not fixed this issue for over 6 hours, where upload and download speeds are 1/5 of what they are supposed to be) and it couldn't have come on a worse day for my schedule. - 2023, Saturday, September 30th

I continued gameplay for a second consecutive week today. I stayed in rank 69, and made slight progress in the new rank, only completing 4 quests. I did 0 card upgrades this week.

Near the end, I decided to do card upgrades again, even without a quest telling me to, and so I did 1 card upgrade this week. I decided not to play the event this week. I eventually wrapped up and quit. I remembered to open the free capsules again today. - 2023, Saturday, October 21st

I continued gameplay for a fifth consecutive week today. I stayed in rank 69, and made slight progress in the new rank, only completing 1 quest (starting with 11/16 and ending with 12/16) I thought the quests I had would be possible to do today, but they were taking way too long, and I had to quit. I still hope to make it to rank 70 by the middle of 2023 November. Near the end, I decided to do card upgrades again, even without a quest telling me to, and so I did 1 card upgrade this week. I decided not to play the event this week, even though it was a Halloween event. I eventually wrapped up and quit. I remembered to open the free capsules again today. - 2023, Saturday, October 28th

I continued gameplay for a sixth consecutive week today. I finally made it to rank 70, and made slight progress in the new rank. I decided to go into the Halloween event this week, even though I missed a day. I eventually wrapped up and quit. I remembered to open the free capsules again today. It took me a long time to go from rank 60 to rank 70, as I had a ton of downtime. I also didn't play each rank to 100% completion before moving forward. - 2023, Saturday, November 4th

I continued gameplay for a seventh consecutive week today. I stayed in rank 70 today, and made slight progress in the new rank. 

The game had severe issues with getting data and doing an update, and had to be reloaded 4 times before I could play.

I decided to go into the Communist Crusade event this week.

I had a very long session, as I was doing an extensive hard drive backup while playing.

I remembered to open the free capsules again today.

I eventually wrapped up and quit.

Data from this week is going into a new repository. - 2023, Saturday, November 11th

I broke my 7 consecutive week streak today by not playing this week. I am adjusting my schedule, and I didn't have the time to play this week. - 2023, Saturday, November 18th

I skipped my session for a second consecutive week, as I didn't have the time to play due to waking up too late, and having lots of ongoing projects alongside this. - 2023, Saturday, November 25th

I resumed gameplay this week, making progress in rank 70 (going from 4/16 to 10/16) and playing the ANew Atlantis event extensively. I eventually quit when I ran low on battery. - 2023, Saturday, December 2nd

I continued weekly gameplay this week for a second consecutive week, making some progress in rank 70 (going from 10/16 to 12/16) and playing for an excessively large amount of time. I eventually quit when I found a stopping point. - 2023, Saturday, December 9th

</details>

I continued weekly gameplay this week for a third consecutive week, making brief progress in rank 70 (going from 12/16 to 13/16) and playing for a shorter amount of time. I eventually quit when I found a good stopping point. - 2023, Saturday, December 16th

### Glorious Potato Factory event

<details><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

There was a new event available this week that was quite addicting. It is based off Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It also has a really good soundtrack. I played the event for way too long today, and made it to rank 6. It is active next week as well, so I intend to play it further. - 2022 Saturday, March 5th

I continued to play the Glorious Potato Factory event again this week, unfortunately, I won't be making it past rank 9. Eventually, I ran out of things to do, and ran out of time. I am still hoping to get the soundtrack. This week, I went from rank 6 to rank 9. The event ends on Monday, so I won't be able to progress more. It was a good event. - 2022 Saturday March 13th

### Supreme Supervillain event

<details><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

There was a new event available this week that was somewhat interesting. I played it, since it is here for 2 weeks, and because I have never played it before (since it is brand new) I played the event for way too long today, and made it to rank 4. It is active next week as well, so I intend to play it further. - 2022 Saturday, March 28th

I played the event heavily again this week, the event ends in less than 48 hours, so I just made it as far as I could. I went from rank 5 to rank 7, 7 out of 8 quests completed. I could have made it to rank 8, but I received an `upgrade 2 cards` quest after I spent nearly all my dark science. It is fine, I don't use gold anyways, and 10 gold isn't very much. - 2022, Saturday, June 4th

### Comrades Communist Vacation event

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

There was a new event this week known as `Comrade's Communist Vacation` I spent a long time in this event, making it to rank 5, making more progress, then quitting. This is also the closest I will get to playing ~~AdVenture~~ Vacation Tycoon. The event will be active next week as well. I spent over an hour in the event today. I did several card upgrades, completed several quests, and made enough progress to make the event enjoyable next week as well. There was an ad that played that crashed the event, it took a long time to regain access, I ended up closing and reopening the application. Ads in Hyper Hippo Games have always been very unstable. - 2023, Saturday, March 25th

I played the event for a second and final consecutive week. I spent some time in the event, making it to rank 8. I spent over an hour in the event today. I did several card upgrades, and completed several quests. - 2023, Saturday, April 1st

### Comrades & Cockatrices event

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

There was a new event this week known as `Comrades & Cockatrices` I spent a long time in this event, making it to rank 5, making more progress, then quitting. This event was new, so I played it due to it likely not recurring very often, and because the description was a little tempting. I also had tons of time. The event will be active next week as well. I spent over an hour in the event today. I did several card upgrades, completed several quests, and made enough progress to make the event enjoyable next week as well. - 2023, Saturday, April 29th

I continued to play the event this week, I was unable to make it to rank 8. I made moderate progress, but didn't have the time to complete one more objective. - 2023, Saturday, May 6th

There was a new event this week known as `Farm to table` despite this being a brand new event, very little time was available for it (less than 3 hours) and I had to go and get a flu shot, so I didn't have time to play the event today. - 2023, Saturday, October 7th

### HyperHippo ad controversy (2022 March 26th - 2022 July 16th)

The parent company for AdVenture Communist and AdVenture Capitalist (and also AdVenture Ages, and Vacation Tycoon (newly released) which I don't play) is having an ongoing controversy regarding suppressing community criticism regarding increasing montization of their games. It currently looks like the company is going to run itself out of business over greed, so my gameplay of the 2 games is now on life support. I hope to continue on for as long as I can, but be prepared that the cord may be cut any day now. Unfortunately, these are online only games that don't have offline play support, so when HyperHippo dies, I can no longer play.

It is looking like they are going to survive this controversy, but I can't be sure. - 2022 March 26th to 2022 July 16th.
